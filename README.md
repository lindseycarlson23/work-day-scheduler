# **Work Day Scheduler**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a basic scheduling tool for planning your work day by the hour. You are able to click on the box next to each hour and enter your task for that hour. When you return to the site later in the day, it will still show what you entered.

In this project, I focused on using jQuery to add dynamic functionality. I also used dayjs for the time and date information.
